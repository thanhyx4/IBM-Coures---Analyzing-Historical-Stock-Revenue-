    "Before diving into building the system, you'll want to first gather some details about the project. This information will help guide your decisions and set expectations for all the stakeholders. Here are the steps you might take:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Identify a business problem** - The company needs a news article classifier to integrate into the application they are building. You'll want to identify the relevant business metrics and determine if the technology can indeed help improve those metrics. In this case, an ML model can help scale up the company's operations as they get more news sources. Manual sorting can't keep up with the velocity of the data, and traditional rule-based algorithms may have given subpar results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Brainstorm AI solutions** - This part has already been done for you. The previous developer settled on an AI solution that classified news articles using their title. In other projects, you may want to brainstorm a few different solutions to see which one addresses the business problem most effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assess the feasibility and value of potential solutions** - ML has demonstrated excellent performance in the area of text classification, so you're confident that this project can be successful. The company already has a prototype, but they want to build something better. Here, you can ask about the data collection process and the problems they encountered with the initial deployment. To assess project ethics, you can also ask if there is an official agreement with the news sources, and if users are linked directly to the publisher's website if they click on an article. Determine the company's stance on fake news and other types of misinformation. Make sure this is a project that moves humanity forward and aligns with your personal ethical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Determine milestones and budget for resourcing** - Identify the metrics for success and estimate the time and resources needed to carry out the project. Since the company is just starting to integrate ML into their workflow, they also want to better understand its capabilities. They have defined a simple model to predict an article's topic based only on its title. The initial model's results establish a baseline measure of performance as you improve the system. You committed 3 weeks to build and test a proof-of-concept based only on their existing prototype. This will help you estimate future timelines and have a feel for the resources you'll need to build a proper end-to-end project."

    "Earlier in this course, you learned that preparing the data effectively is key to good model performance. If the human labellers employed to provide the ground truth for the dataset were working with ambiguous labelling instructions, they may produce inconsistent labels. These inconsistent labels make it harder for the learning algorithm to understand the relationship between the inputs and outputs.\n",

Where might there be sources of ambiguity? What changes could help your model make good predictions? Use the code cell below to explore the datasets. If you see something wrong, don't fix it just yet. You'll have the chance to make any fixes later in the project."

    "One of the things you want to ensure in serving models is the data transformations. It has to follow the same pipeline as your training data. The problem with the code above is it runs the risk of making a mistake in loading the vocabulary. If you were doing several experiments and edited the code above, you might accidentally load a different vocabulary file (e.g. from Experiment 3 instead of 2). That can make a well-trained model have unreliable predictions because it's preprocessing the titles differently.\n",

You will do that below and see that you can just pass a string directly to the model instead of an integer array."

For example, a person suddenly becomes famous but if there were no related articles in the training data, your model can only use the other words in the new titles to deduce the topic."

    "Great work completing this project. You've successfully applied all the steps of the Machine Learning Project lifecycle to a real-world project, from scoping to data to modeling to deployment. You tackled common challenges like fixing unbalanced train/dev/test splits, addressing labeling ambiguity, and deploying a model into production.\n",

    "The Machine Learning Project Lifecycle is an iterative process and you might have found yourself jumping from one stage to another to produce better results for your project. Given your findings so far, you can summarize your recommendations to the product owner so they can successfully integrate ML into their news app. Here are some aspects you might like to take note of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How would you reduce label ambiguity when you ask human labellers to provide the ground truth?\n",
    "* What is the highest accuracy you got with the prototype model and will it be sufficient for the application?\n",

    "* What modifications can you suggest to the app? For example, can an article appear across different categories?\n",

    "We encourage you to share and discuss your findings on [the DLAI Forum](https://community.deeplearning.ai/c/course-q-a/machine-learning-engineering-for-production/mlep-learner-projects/224). You can post about anything from a good labeling strategy to a state-of-the-art model built for this kind of task. You can also apply what you learned here to a different dataset and showcase it as your personal project. We're excited to see what you build!"
